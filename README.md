# ARYAMAN KUSHWAHA

Every project, every line of code here is a challenge. A rebellion. A journey that never ends. If youâ€™re here, youâ€™ve already taken the first step into the unknown.

## ðŸ“š THE PROJECTS

### 1. **Emotion Detection (Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV)**
This world tells you to hide your feelings, to mask what you truly are. But I wanted to see if the machine could tear down that facade.  
With **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **OpenCV**, Iâ€™ve built an emotion detection model that reads your face like a book. It doesnâ€™t lie. And neither should you.  
*The machine knows your truth.*

- **Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **How to Run:**  
  1. Clone the repo.
  2. Install the dependencies:  
     `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  3. Run the Python script. Let the machine read your face.

### 2. **Apple-Inspired Website (Three.js, React, JavaScript)**
Think you know what web design looks like? Think again. Inspired by the clean aesthetics of Apple, but this website takes it a step further. Using **Three.js** for 3D graphics and **React** for a dynamic user experience, itâ€™s not just another site â€” itâ€™s an experience.  
*Youâ€™ve seen Appleâ€™s vision. Now youâ€™ll see mine.*

- **Technologies Used:** Three.js, React, JavaScript

### 3. **The Three.js Journey (Daily Updates)**
This repo is where Iâ€™m pushing the limits every single day. A personal journey into mastering **Three.js**, one commit at a time. Each commit is a new lesson, a step deeper into 3D web design. This isnâ€™t a tutorial. This is a way of thinking, a new way of creating.  
*The journey doesnâ€™t stop. And neither do I.*

- **Commit Frequency:** Daily updates
- **Goal:** Master Three.js, break the conventional web, and build a 3D future.

## ðŸ’» THE TOOLS I USE

- **Python** â€” The language of AI, the key to understanding the system.
- **TensorFlow & Keras** â€” Neural networks that break down emotions, because the system canâ€™t hide whatâ€™s real.
- **OpenCV** â€” Seeing things differently. Through the lens of computer vision, the world is not as it seems.
- **Three.js** â€” Breaking the flat, boring 2D web. 3D is the future, and Iâ€™m here to create it.
- **React** â€” A frontend framework that turns static pages into interactive, dynamic experiences.
- **JavaScript** â€” The foundation of everything. Without it, the web is nothing. With it, we have power.
- **Blender, WebGL, Three.js** â€” Iâ€™m learning 3D modeling to craft the future of web design. Why settle for flat when you can have depth?

## ðŸ”¨ HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

This repo isnâ€™t a playground for amateurs. If youâ€™re going to contribute, you better be ready to prove it. No room for half-hearted code here. Only the real deal. If you think you can add value, show me. Iâ€™m watching.

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch.
3. Make your changes â€” and make them count.
4. Push your changes and submit a pull request. Donâ€™t waste my time.
